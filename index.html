            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>

                Born and raised in a mid-sized city in the islands of Central Philippines, I grew up witnessing how technology could bridge gaps and transform lives. This inspired my journey as a data scientist and developer, where I’ve built AI-powered solutions leveraging geospatial, demographic and shopper data. I have also led product strategy across Southeast Asia and ANZ, driving impactful business and consumer outcomes.
            </p>
        
            <p>
Beyond my professional work, I’m deeply passionate about open-source software, learning the fundamentals of computer science, and building tools that make a difference - especially for people who live in rural Philippines, where I’m focused on creating tech innovations to improve everyday life.
            </p>
         
            <p>
A lifelong football fan and former competitive athlete, I bring the same passion, discipline & collaborative attitue to everything I do. Whether it’s on the field or behind a keyboard, I’m driven by a desire to build solutions that create meaningful change.
